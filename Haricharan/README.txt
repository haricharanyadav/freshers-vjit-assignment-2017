Hi this is Haricharan
please execute restaurant file first.

 We then proceed to the menu where the price of each item is displayed in accordance with the quantity, for each of the courses available.
 Next the bill is calculated and Feedback has to be filled which will be stored in the database created.
 Except for creating database and the feedback form, Maven has been used.
thankyou.
